# Git Branching Practice – Java Array Operations

This repository is created to **practice Git branching, feature isolation, and merging** using a simple Java program.

## 📂 Project Overview

* Base Java program creates an **array**
* Separate branches were created for individual features:

  * `sort-branch` → Array sorting logic
  * `insert-branch` → Insert element into array
  * `delete-branch` → Delete element from array
* All branches were **merged back into `main`**

This simulates a **real-world feature-based Git workflow**.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy (Visual)

```
main
 │
 ├── sort-branch
 │       └── (array sorting logic)
 │
 ├── insert-branch
 │       └── (array insertion logic)
 │
 └── delete-branch
         └── (array deletion logic)

All branches merged → main
```

## 🧠 What I Practiced

* Creating and switching branches
* Working on independent features
* Merging multiple branches into main
* Understanding clean Git history

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Version Control:** Git

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is purely for **learning and practicing Git fundamentals**, especially branching and merging using a simple, understandable Java program.
